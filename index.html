<h2>About Cozumel, Mexico</h2>
<div id="AboutCozumelMexico">
<p>
Cozumel, Mexico is a tropical island right outside of Mexico. Before the Spanish came, Cozumel used to be it's own little island. When the Spanish came, after taking over Mexico, they were scouting around the area by ship to see if there was any more land and they found some! They went and explored Cozumel seeing that there were no humans there yet, they thought, "Cozumel is such a little island, it would be odd for it to be called it's own country." So then, they made Cozumel part of Mexico.
